            <h2>Alma 7:11-12</h2>
            <p>And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the
                word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.
                And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will
                take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that
                he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.</p>

            <h2>Doctrine and Covenants 121:45-46</h2>
            <p>Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue
                garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the
                doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven. The Holy Ghost shall be
                thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy
                dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever
                and ever.</p>
